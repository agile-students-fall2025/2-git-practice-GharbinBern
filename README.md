[Code Smell Detection by Exploiting Parameter Tuning Techniques for Sustainable Software Evolution](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13198-025-02951-w)

## Why I Find It Interesting

This article explores how **parameter tuning techniques** can be leveraged to improve code smell detection, which is an important part of maintaining sustainable software. Code smells are those parts of code that may work, but in the long‐run lead to maintenance issues, harder refactoring, or technical debt. Being able to detect them more accurately or earlier helps teams keep the codebase healthier and easier to evolve.

What especially caught my attention:

- The use of *parameter tuning* as a way to adapt detection tools — rather than “one size fits all.” Because different projects may have different styles, scales, or constraints, the idea that you can tweak the detection parameters (thresholds, metrics, etc.) to best suit your specific codebase seems powerful.
- How this contributes to *software sustainability*. It’s not just about detecting smells, but about doing so in a way that allows the code to evolve without accumulating undue technical debt.
- The relevance to real-world engineering: I like how this ties theory (tuning, empirical evaluation) with practical impact (making maintenance and evolution more manageable).
